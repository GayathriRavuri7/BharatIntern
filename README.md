# Task 1 :-
## House Price Prediction :
Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression. Linear Regression is a fundamental and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for predicting numerical values based on input features. It establishes a linear relationship between the input variables (also called features, independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable).

# Task 2:-
## Wine Quality Prediction
Machine Learning model to predict Wine Quality using linear regression. Linear Regression is a fundamental and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for predicting numerical values based on input features. It establishes a linear relationship between the input variables (also called features, independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable).

# Task 3:-
## Iris Flower Classification
Machine Learning model to predict the different species of flowers on the length of there petals and sepals. I have used Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifier to predict the species.
